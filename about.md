> I'm a Computer Scientist who fell in love with Data, Automating the stuffs and Open Sourcing.

I am a Data Scientist in the making, Learning to hack into the machines and automate using Python scripts.

I'm a full time student, studying Computer Science and Engineering from Osmania University. ;)  

I'm passionate about coding into Python and love Neuro Science. I spend most of my time with/in
`Python`, `Neuro Science`, `Automation`, `Machine Learning`, `Cognitive Computing`, `Cognitive Intelligence`, `Open Sourcing`.

Check out my [research Publications](/research/) and [codes](/code/) to know more about me. If you think, we have
something in common. Let's talk about it.
